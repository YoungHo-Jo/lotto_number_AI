## Lotto Number AI

This repository is for my study and assignment in University that I am attending.

Used programming language is python, because of the conveience of coding.

And OpenCV for reading and writing some images more quickly and easily is the important part of reconizing Lotto numbers.
Also, to reconize images of Lotto number in integer, the Perceptron Theory, the basic artifical intelligence using neural network, is used.

If you want to participate in this repository, don't hesitate.

I will appreciate it.
